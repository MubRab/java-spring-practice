# Section 7.3: Dynamic Webpages using HTTP methods

In this example we use various methods for GET and POST actions and we use HTML forms to make such requests. For the method that handles the GET requests, we annotate it with @GetMapping and for the method that handles the POST request, we annotate it with @PostMapping.

This example demonstrates a basic web app, which allows the user to enter data into the HTML form, stores the data and displays the added data on the same web page.
